KPMG_Internship </h1>
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached  KPMG and needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy effectively. 

However, in order to support the analysis, We spoke to the Assototor for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the dataset's quality, the better chance you will be able to use it to drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months

## The internship is divided into three tasks:-

 <h3 align = 'center'> TASK 1: Data Quality Assessment </h3>
 <h4 align = 'center'> Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis </h4>
 
The task is to review the data quality of the dataset and Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.
Standard Data Quality Table is the reference table we used for checking our dataset quality.

We found some of impurities in the dataset, which are:
- Dataset has irrelevant fields.
- Found outliers, reoccurrence of data and empty values in certain records.
- Found Inconsistent values for the same attribute.

<h3 align = 'center'> TASK 2: Data Insights </h3>
<h4 align = 'center'> Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. </h4>

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. These customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour.
[New_Customer_File]()

The task is to Create a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach we will be taking to identify which of the 1000 customers Sprocket Central Pty Ltd should target, based on the dataset. Explain the three phases :
- Data Exploration
- Model Development
- Interpretation.

We use RFM(Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) analysis to find out the best customers.RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns.
